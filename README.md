# learn-fastapi

## to add to the project:
* config.py to setup env variables which are already done using dotenv
* add timeout functionality for jwt tokens

## to figure out:
* how oauth2 works
* how relationships work in databases and how adding return type to schema adds it in our return value but separate column is not added in our table
